## Setup Instructions

We recommend using `Node.js version 20` with this course. The project will be built from scratch so most of the folders in this repo are just for reference. Later in the course, the `api` directory will be used to simulate an API server. To get set up, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/btholt/citr-v9-project.git
```

To use the version of node this course was built with:

- with [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm), `fnm use --install-if-missing`
- with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), `nvm install`
